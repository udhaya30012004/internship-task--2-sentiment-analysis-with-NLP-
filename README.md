# 🧠 Sentiment Analysis using NLP

This project demonstrates **Sentiment Analysis** on text data using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. It classifies text into categories like **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** based on its content.

---

## 💡 Project Objective

To build a model that can predict the **sentiment** of a given text (e.g., a product review, tweet, or comment) using various NLP preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms.

---

## 🧾 Features

- Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, etc.)
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF** / **CountVectorizer**
- Machine learning model for classification (e.g., **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, or **SVM**)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Optional: Sentiment prediction on custom user input
